#### Backwards selection models ###
##################################

## since most people use backwards selection methods for risk factor analyses - it is a good idea to see if the results from the univariate model match those from a backwards selection model 
# for this will will start with a fully adjusted model and remove covariates one by one, starting with the covariate with the highest p-value. Once all covaraites have p-values under 0.05 we will have our final model 
## using any DHPS mutation as the outcome
